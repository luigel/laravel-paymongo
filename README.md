> ## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require luigel/laravel-paymongo
```

**Laravel 6 and up** uses Package Auto-Discovery, so doesn't require you to manually add the ServiceProvider.

Put your `Secret Key` and `Public Key` and the `Webhook secret` in your `.env` file.

```
# Paymongo
PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY=
PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY=
# This is the secret from the webhook you created.
PAYMONGO_WEBHOOK_SIG=

```

> ## Compatibility and Supported Versions
>
> Laravel-Paymongo supports Laravel 6.x and up.
>
> ## Sample Source Code
>
> I created and a work in progress sample application using this package. The source code can be found here https://github.com/luigel/sample-paymongo.
>
> ## Usage

**_Note_:** You can get data using getData() method for all the models. It also supports magic method for getting the data from the model.

```php
$data = $paymentMethod->getData();
$billing = $paymentMethod->getBilling();
$billingName = $paymentMethod->getBillingName();
```

> ### Payment Methods
>
> ### Create Payment Method
>
> Creates a payment methods. It holds the information such as credit card information and billing information.

**Payload**

Refer to [Paymongo documentation](https://developers.paymongo.com/reference#post_payment-methods) for payload.

**Sample**

```php
use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;

$paymentMethod = Paymongo::paymentMethod()->create([
    'type' => 'card',
    'details' => [
        'card_number' => '4343434343434345',
        'exp_month' => 12,
        'exp_year' => 25,
        'cvc' => "123",
    ],
    'billing' => [
        'address' => [
            'line1' => 'Somewhere there',
            'city' => 'Cebu City',
            'state' => 'Cebu',
            'country' => 'PH',
            'postal_code' => '6000',
        ],
        'name' => 'Rigel Kent Carbonel',
        'email' => 'rigel20.kent@gmail.com',
        'phone' => '0935454875545'
    ],
]);
```

> ### Get Payment Method

Retrieve a payment method given an ID. Just pass the payment method id to `find($id)` method.

**Sample**

```php
use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;

$paymentMethod = Paymongo::paymentMethod()->find('pm_wr98R2gwWroVxfkcNVZBuXg2');
```

> ### Payment Intents
>
> ### Create Payment Intent

A payment intent is designed to handle a complex payment process. To compare payment intents with tokens, tokens have a straight forward credit card payment process where it does not check if 3DS is required to fulfill a payment while payment intent is designed to handle such process.

**Payload**

Refer to [Paymongo documentation](https://developers.paymongo.com/reference#post_payment-intents) for payload guidelines.

**Sample**

```php
use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;

$paymentIntent = Paymongo::paymentIntent()->create([
    'amount' => 100,
    'payment_method_allowed' => [
        'card'
    ],
    'payment_method_options' => [
        'card' => [
            'request_three_d_secure' => 'automatic'
        ]
    ],
    'description' => 'This is a test payment intent',
    'statement_descriptor' => 'LUIGEL STORE',
    'currency' => "PHP",
]);
```

> ### Cancel Payment Intent

Cancels the payment intent.

**Sample**

```php
use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;

$paymentIntent = Paymongo::paymentIntent()->find('pi_hsJNpsRFU1LxgVbxW4YJHRs6');
$cancelledPaymentIntent = $paymentIntent->cancel();
```

### Attach Payment Intent

Attach the payment intent.

**Sample**

```php
use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;

$paymentIntent = Paymongo::paymentIntent()->find('pi_hsJNpsRFU1LxgVbxW4YJHRs6');
// Attached the payment method to the payment intent
$successfulPayment = $paymentIntent->attach('pm_wr98R2gwWroVxfkcNVZBuXg2');
```

> ### Get Payment Intent

You can retrieve a Payment Intent by providing a payment intent ID. The prefix for the id is `pi_` followed by a unique hash representing the payment. Just pass the payment id to `find($paymentIntentId)` method.

**Sample**

```php
use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;

$paymentIntent = Paymongo::paymentIntent()->find('pi_hsJNpsRFU1LxgVbxW4YJHRs6');
```

            'type' => $token->type
        ]
    ]);
```

> ### Get Payment

$payments = Paymongo::payment()->all();
```

> ### Tokens

use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;

$token = Paymongo::token()
    ->create([
        'number' => '4343434343434345',
        'exp_month' => 12,
        'exp_year' => 25,

                'city' => 'Cebu City',
                'postal_code' => '6000',
                'country' => 'PH'
            ],
            'name' => 'Rigel Kent Carbonel',
            'email' => 'rigel20.kent@gmail.com',

$token = Paymongo::token()->find($tokenId);
```

> ### Webhooks

**Payload**

Refer to [Paymongo documentation](https://developers.paymongo.com/reference#post_webhooks-1) for payload guidelines.

**Sample**

```php
use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;

$webhook = Paymongo::webhook()->create([
    'url' => 'http://your-domain/webhook/source-chargeable',
    'events' => [
        'source.chargeable'
    ]
]);
```

> ### List all Webhooks

Returns all the webhooks you previously created, with the most recent webhooks returned first.

**Sample**

```php
use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;

$webhook = Paymongo::webhook()->all();
```

> ### Enable or Disable Webhooks

Set the webhook enable or disable.

**Sample**

```php
use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;
// Enable webhook
$webhook = Paymongo::webhook()->find('hook_9VrvpRkkYqK6twbhuvcVTtjM')->enable();

// Disable webhook
$webhook = Paymongo::webhook()->find('hook_9VrvpRkkYqK6twbhuvcVTtjM')->disable();
```

> ### Update Webhook

Updates a specific webhook

**Sample**

```php
use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;

$webhook = Paymongo::webhook()->find('hook_9VrvpRkkYqK6twbhuvcVTtjM')->update([
    'url' => 'https://update-domain.com/webhook'
]);
```

> ### Webhook Middleware
>
> Laravel paymongo has a middleware for protecting your webhook, suggested by Paymongo. Check the link here. [**Securing a Webhook. Optional but highly recommended.**](https://developers.paymongo.com/docs/webhooks#3-securing-a-webhook-optional-but-highly-recommended)
> You can put your webhook in the `api.php` like so.

```php
Route::post('webhook/paymongo', PaymongoWebhookController::class)->middleware('paymongo.signature');

```

> ### Artisan Commands

We can list, add, and toggle the `webhooks` using the artisan commands out of the box.

```bash
# Adding webhook.
php artisan paymongo:webhook
# List webhooks
php artisan paymongo:list-webhooks
# Enable webhook with webhook id
php artisan paymongo:toggle-webhook {webhook_id} --enable
# Disable webhook with webhook id
php artisan paymongo:toggle-webhook {webhook_id} --disable
# Or you can just run paymongo:toggle-webhook and input needed data on runtime.
php artisan paymongo:toggle-webhook
```

### **Todo**

-   [x] Add unit test for the `BaseModel`.
-   [ ] Fix the magic method when accessing a nested data with `underscore` ("\_").
-   [x] Add artisan commands for adding, enabling, and disabling webhooks.
-   [x] Fix the test case for the `PaymongoValidateSignature` middleware.
-   [x] Transfer from travis to github actions.
